Course information for Astro 128 and Astro 256

In order to indicate interest in enrolling in Astro 128, you simply need to send an email to datalab@astro.berkeley.edu.  When that happens we will review your transcript, follow up with any questions, and send you a link to a short python coding exercise that youâ€™ll need to complete and submit.  

No matter when your actual enrollment dates are, the deadline to email us with interest in enrolling in the lab class is **Thursday Nov 15th**.  You should plan to have your code test to us around that time (or before) as well.  We will announce class enrollment decisions during the Phase II period.  This is the only way it is possible to apply for enrollment in the class.
